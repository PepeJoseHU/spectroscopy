SPECTROSCOPY SCRIPTS
====================


plotSpec
--------
This can plot spectra contained in FITS files, or in ASCII tables.
It is convenient because it can plot several spectra from different formats at
the same time. More details about colors, radial velocity correction and reading
 format at the beginning of the file.
